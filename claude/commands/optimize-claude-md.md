# Optimize CLAUDE.md and Commands

Optimize project configuration files following these principles:

## Key Optimization Steps

1. **Lean CLAUDE.md** - Keep to essential project context only
2. **Extract Rules** - Move strict coding rules to `coderules.md`
3. **Modularize** - Split large instructions into focused files
4. **Test & Refine** - Remove instructions that aren't followed

## Optimization Checklist

- [ ] CLAUDE.md under 50 lines
- [ ] Coding rules in separate `coderules.md`
- [ ] Commands are single-purpose and focused
- [ ] Hierarchical context for subfolders
- [ ] No redundant or conflicting instructions

## Target Structure

```
project/
├── CLAUDE.md           # Lean project overview
├── coderules.md       # Strict coding standards
└── .claude/commands/  # Optimized commands
```

Apply Linus Torvalds quality standards. Keep everything concise and effective.
